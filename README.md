# odin-recipes
Good morning, this project is designed to let us implment all skills that
we've learned so far to create a wesite about recipes.
So far, I have been taught the basics of html code.
upon completing this, I will understand how to conect my terminal to github,
make commits, and use the basics of html to design a website.
